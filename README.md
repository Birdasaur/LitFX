# LitFX
Bolt on upgrades for your JavaFX GUI that provide custom special effects such as Lightning, Radio Waves/Bands, Line of Sight lighting and Shadowing. LitFX can apply its effects to your JavaFX GUI as a transparent overlay such that the effects interact with your various Nodes with little apriori knowledge of your layout and without moving your stuff around.
It's god damn dark magic so have fun.
