# LitFX [![JFXCentral](https://img.shields.io/badge/Find_me_on-JFXCentral-blue?logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white)](https://www.jfx-central.com/libraries/litfx)
Bolt on upgrades for your JavaFX GUI that provide custom special effects such as:

- Lightning 
- Radio Waves/Bands
- Line of Sight lighting and Shadowing
- Animated Window and Floating Panes. 
- Flame convolution

LitFX can apply its effects to your JavaFX GUI as a transparent overlay such that the effects interact with your various Nodes with little apriori knowledge of your layout and without moving your stuff around.

It's like god damn dark magic so have fun.
